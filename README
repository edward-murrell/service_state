What is it?
===========
Service state is a status page for Drupal. It is used to expose the state of
the system. This might include configuration items, connectivity to any remote
services, and general data about the health of the site.

The status page is updated via ajax, so badly written plugins and misbehaving
checks will not render the page unusable. Service status messages are also
available via JSON. Status messages may be return a state of  Message, OK,
Warning, or Failure.

How do I use it
===============
The main page can be found at /servicestate

Plugins are added via the hook system. In this way, various modules can
add their own specific state hooks. For example, a module for connecting
to a database or webservice could at a service state hook that indicates
if the service is available.

Out of the box, Service state exposes the main Drupal database endpoint,
the last time cron was run, any memcache servers currently configured,
and if said memcache servers are responding. 

API
===
Service states are exposed via by implementing HOOK_servicestate_services().
